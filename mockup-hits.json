Apparently, a form of product rule is needed to find the total derivative of <em class=\"hl\">[imath]C = B \\cdot A[\/imath]<\/em>. I'm aware that both [imath]A,B[\/imath] are Frechet differentiable (presuming [imath]k>1[\/imath]), but I'm not aware of a product rule regarding total differentiation of anything other than a product of real valued functions. Is there such a rule? I suspect there is a higher order chain rule as well, yet that which u ... "

Yes, If [imath]A[\/imath] has a left-inverse [imath]B[\/imath], then <em class=\"hl\">[imath]BA = I[\/imath]<\/em>, and so [imath]A[\/imath] is injective (as a linear map). But it is a linear operator on a finite dimensional space, so it is also surjective, and so it has a right-inverse. ... "
